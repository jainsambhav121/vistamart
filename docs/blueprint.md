## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Muted rose (#C6A3A3), lending a sophisticated and subtle feel to the storefront. This unconventional color avoids common e-commerce palettes and stands out in its elegance.
- Background color: Light grayish-rose (#F0E6E6), a desaturated, brighter shade of the primary, keeps the layout airy and harmonious.
- Accent color: Soft Lavender (#B09EB0), slightly desaturated to ensure it enhances rather than overpowers the overall aesthetic, used for interactive elements such as buttons or links.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' (serif), lending a high-end feel
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif), ensuring readability
- Use minimalist line icons for categories, cart, and user profile to maintain a clean interface.
- Grid-based layout to showcase products effectively with clear, consistent spacing.
